## Literature Review

### Introduction
Understanding the behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their vulnerability to adversarial attacks is crucial for enhancing their robustness and reliability in practical applications. This literature review aims to provide insights into the intuitive properties of DNNs and the mechanisms behind adversarial attacks, drawing from seminal works in the field.

### Fundamentals of Adversarial Attacks
1. **Szegedy et al., 2014**: This foundational paper identified the existence of adversarial attacks, highlighting the susceptibility of DNNs to perturbations in input data.

2. **Goodfellow et al., 2015**: Building upon earlier research, this work delved deeper into the rationale behind adversarial examples, proposing the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) for efficient generation of adversarial examples. The authors also explained the phenomenon of transferability of attacks across different models.

3. **Kurakin et al., 2016**: Explored practical implications of adversarial attacks by introducing the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) for generating adversarial examples. This work provided insights into the robustness of DNNs against iterative attacks.

### Understanding Adversarial Attacks
1. **Ilyas et al., 2019**: This work contributed meaningful explanations behind adversarial attacks and their transferability across models, attributing it to non-robust features of the networks. The authors shed light on the underlying vulnerabilities of DNNs and their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations.

2. **Su et al., 2019**: Investigated the minimal changes required to generate adversarial attacks, introducing the concept of single-pixel attacks. This work provided insights into the fine-grained nature of adversarial perturbations and their impact on DNN decision-making.

### Visualizing Adversarial Attacks
Visualizing adversarial attacks offers concrete evidence of vulnerabilities in DNN decision-making processes. By comparing the transferability of attacks across various models, researchers can gain valuable insights into the robustness of different architectures and inform strategies for improving network security.

### Conclusion
The literature reviewed here provides a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of DNNs and the mechanisms behind adversarial attacks. By leveraging insights from these seminal works, researchers can develop more robust and reliable neural network architectures, thus advancing the field of machine learning security.
